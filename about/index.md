I am currently an NCSU Libraries Fellow working in both the Digital Libraries Initiatives Department and Special Collections Research Center. My undergraduate degree is in political science and I graduated with my MLS from University of Maryland in 2015. I am passionate about the potential technology has to impact libraries and higher education, and work to integrate that passion into my current project.
## Current Interests and Projects:

* Web Archiving
* Born-Digital Preservation
* Open Source Software Development
