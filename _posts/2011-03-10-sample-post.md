# Getting Started with Your First Static website

## What is this?
This is a website template based on the static website generator Jekyll. It includes a theme based on the Minimal Mistakes theme. Both Jekyll and the base theme are open source projects, with no copyright restrictions. We have taken and modified the base theme to better suit the needs of NCSU faculty and students. We have released this updated version as open source under the XXXXXX license so that it can be used by others. The goal of this template is to make the creation, hosting and updating of a simple personal website as easy as possible. 

## What is a Static Website Generator?

A static website generator is a tool that simplifies the process of creating a static website. It takes simple text files and compiles them into a nicely formatted, professional looking static website. 

## What is a Static Website?
A static website is a website that is delivered to the user exactly as it is stored rather than relying on complicated web applications to interpret the files that are stored on the server before delivering them to the user. The advantage of using a static website rather than a dynamic website is that a static site can be hosted nearly anywhere. It does not rely on complicated web applications, which allows the site to be moved as a simple file directory to nearly any web server. 

## How is using a static website generator different from just making my own site using HTML?
