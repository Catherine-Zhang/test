## Currently

I am currently an NCSU Libraries Fellow. I work in both the Digital Library Initiatives department as well as the Special Collections Research Center. My work in DLI is focused on tools used to harvest social media content. In the Special Collections Research Center I am focused on overseeing a Web Archiving project, with an emphasis on the preservation of the NC State University websites as it relates to the university archives mission of preserving the unique cultural heritage of our institution.
